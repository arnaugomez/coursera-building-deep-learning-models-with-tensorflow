      <span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Final Project
      Overview: Classify Waste Products Using Transfer Learning
    </h1>
    <p><strong>Estimated Reading Time: 15 minutes</strong></p>
    <h3>
      <span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Project Scenario
    </h3>
    <p>
      The city of GreenCity has been struggling with waste management,
      especially in distinguishing between recyclable and organic waste. The
      local waste management organization, EcoClean, is tasked with improving
      the efficiency of waste sorting. However, the current manual process is
      both time-consuming and error-prone. To enhance the system, EcoClean wants
      you to develop an AI-powered solution that can automatically classify
      waste products using image recognition techniques. This project aims to
      build a model that can differentiate between recyclable and organic waste
      products using transfer learning.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Project Background
    </h3>
    <p>
      EcoClean currently lacks an efficient and scalable method to automate the
      waste sorting process. The manual sorting of waste is not only
      labor-intensive but also prone to errors, leading to contamination of
      recyclable materials. The goal of this project is to leverage machine
      learning and computer vision to automate the classification of waste
      products, improving efficiency and reducing contamination rates. The
      project will use transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to
      classify images.
    </p>
    <h3><span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      The aim of the project is to develop an automated waste classification
      model that can accurately differentiate between recyclable and organic
      waste based on images. By the end of this project, you will have trained,
      fine-tuned, and evaluated a model using transfer learning, which can then
      be applied to real-world waste management processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Final Output</strong>: A trained model that classifies waste
      images into recyclable and organic categories.

    <h3>
      <span class="header-link octicon octicon-link"></span>Learning objectives
    </h3>
    <p>After completing this project, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>

      ><br /><strong
        >Task 9: Plot a test image using Extract Features Model (index_to_plot =
        1)</strong
      ><br /><strong
        >Task 10: Plot a test image using Fine-Tuned Model (index_to_plot =

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start the project by developing and deploying a trained model that
      classifies waste images into recyclable and organic categories.
